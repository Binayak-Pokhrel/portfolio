Since childhood, I am addicted in innovation, development, science and technology. I love to spend time working in computer hardware, software and programs. I always wanted to develop my thinking, my ideas into programs. No matter whatever the condition and problem is but, I never stop learning. Thus, for me mistake is also the part of success. Currently, I am looking for best company which will provide me placement for internship. Because, I have a thinking that intern is the workplace which will help me to adapt in real environment. To learn something new from senior developer and to adapt in the real environment, I am willing to join the intern.</p>
